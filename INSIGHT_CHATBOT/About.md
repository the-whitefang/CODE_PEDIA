Basically this is a Chat-bot that takes insights from \
a dataset containing 20,000 rows of records and answers \
the user's question, to the point if it finds the relevant \
answer. The requirement was to check how much time it \
takes for a chatbot to take the user's question -> \
the fetch the dataset -> take the insights -> \
give it to the llama model -> then rephrases the result \ 
for the user side.
